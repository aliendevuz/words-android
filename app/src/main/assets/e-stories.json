The other animals were afraid the lion would kill them all.\n\nThe animals told the lion, “Let’s make a deal. If you promise to eat only one animal each day, then one of us will come to you every day. Then you don’t have to hunt and kill us.”\n\nThe plan sounded well thought-out to the lion, so he agreed, but he also said, “If you don’t come every day, I promise to kill all of you the next day!”\n\nEach day after that, one animal went to the lion so that the lion could eat it. Then, all the other animals were safe.\n\nFinally, it was the rabbit’s turn to go to the lion. The rabbit went very slowly that day, so the lion was angry when the rabbit finally arrived.\n\nThe lion angrily asked the rabbit, “Why are you late?”\n\n“I was hiding from another lion in the forest. That lion said he was the king, so I was afraid.”\n\nThe lion told the rabbit, “I am the only king here! Take me to that other lion, and I will kill him.\"\n\nThe rabbit replied, “I will be happy to show you where he lives.”\n\nThe rabbit led the lion to an old well in the middle of the forest. The well was very deep with water at the bottom. The rabbit told the lion, “Look in there. The lion lives at the bottom.”\n\nWhen the lion looked in the well, he could see his own face in-the water. He thought that was the other lion. Without waiting another moment, the lion jumped into the well to attack the other lion. He never came out.\n\nAll of the other animal in the forest were very pleased with the rabbit’s clever trick."

One day, while playing in the garden, she heard a faint meowing coming from the bushes. Curious, Lily followed the sound and discovered a tiny kitten hiding at the bottom of a tree.\n\nThe poor kitten looked afraid and hungry. Lily gently approached and offered some food from her picnic basket. The kitten, pleased by the kindness, cautiously approached and nibbled on the food.\n\nLily promised to take care of the kitten and keep it safe. She picked up the kitten and carried it home. Her parents agreed to let her keep the kitten, but only if she promised to take good care of it.\n\nAs days passed, Lily and the kitten became inseparable. They played together in the garden and cuddled up at night. Lily named her new friend Whiskers because of the cute little whiskers on its face.\n\nOne evening, as Lily and Whiskers were playing outside, they heard a loud bark. A big, angry dog had arrived in the village and was trying to attack smaller animals. Lily felt scared and knew she had to keep Whiskers safe.\n\nThinking quickly, Lily came up with a clever trick. She grabbed a nearby stick and threw it far away. The dog, distracted by the stick, chased after it, giving Lily and Whiskers enough time to hide safely in their house.\n\nFinally, the dog gave up and left the village. Lily was relieved that her clever trick had worked and that Whiskers was safe. From that moment on, Lily and Whiskers lived happily together, enjoying each other's company and adventures in their little village."

He thought the king would choose him.\n\n“When I’m king,” Theseus told Pelias, “I’ll let you contribute to the defense of our country. You can lead the army.”\n\nPelias became angry. “Father knows I’m famous for my sword skills. He’ll make me king.”\n\n“You?” Theseus yelled. “He won’t choose you!”\n\n“The kingdom is mine!” Pelias claimed. “Father will give it to me—or I’ll use force to take it!”\n\nTheseus made a sudden move to take out his sword. Then Pelias did the same.\n\n“Beating me will be a challenge,” Theseus said. “Fight me now. The winner gets the kingdom!”\n\nPelias agreed.\n\nKing Minos could hear his sons fighting. The youngest son, Jason, stood beside him. He sensed his father’s sadness. The king laid his hand flat on Jason’s arm.\n\n“Your brothers fight too much,” the king told him. “I must protect my kingdom from all harm. They’ll divide it between them. The people won’t know what to do. There’ll be war. I can’t allow either of them to be king. Therefore, I’m making you king. Your kindness has always made you special. It’s the difference between you and your brothers. You can bring peace. They can’t.”\n\nThen the king died. Theseus and Pelias heard that their youngest brother was king. They were surprised. They realized that their fighting was wrong. It had kept them from saying goodbye to their father. They agreed to have Jason as their king. He was the best choice."

And the tools were in a different position, too,” Maria said. They were surprised and happy. That day, they worked hard and finished five lines.\n\nBut in the morning, ten lines were done! Each day they did a lot of work. Each night, someone else did an equal amount of work. In a week, the whole field was finished. “Tomorrow I will sell the crops and pay the lord,” Arthur said. But that morning, the crops were gone. A bag was in the middle of the field. It contained money.\n\n“Maria, let’s see who has helped us work.” Through a hole in the wall, they saw a funny sight. The cats were dancing in the field and eating corn! Now Arthur knew what had happened. The cats had worked at night! After that, Arthur was very nice to his cats and fed them lots of corn."

Many of them needed medicine and made regular visits to doctors.\n\nBut the video wasn’t all bad news. It showed ways to pick up trash and why it’s important to do this. It said people can make a difference to their environment. The video’s important features made Joe associate trash with hurting people.\n\nOne day Joe walked through a park. He recognized some of the problems from the video. One instance of these problems was the trash in the pond. It was full of plastic cups. There was too much trash. Joe didn’t want it to hurt anyone.\n\nHe told his grandfather about the park. His grandfather said, “You know, it’s a tradition in our family to help people. That’s why we give food to poor people. Maybe you can help people by cleaning the park.”\n\nCleaning the park would involve hard work. Joe decided to organize a group to help him. He chose a wide area of the park. It had the most trash. He asked his family and friends to come. On Saturday, he gave everyone a sharp stick. They wondered why. He said, “You use the stick’s tip to pick up trash. This makes it easier.” They worked for six weeks. Different people helped each time, but Joe was always there.\n\nIn that period of time, Joe saw a range of results. There was no trash in the water. People could swim in it. Joe knew that was a good sign. He was happy because he helped his environment."

Set wanted to be king.\n\nOsiris made his annual trip around Egypt and led religious events. The villages gave him beautiful shells and colorful feathers as gifts.\n\nWhen Osiris returned, Set brought a beautiful wooden box from behind a curtain.\n\n“If someone fits inside this box, I will give it to him or her,” Set said.\n\nOsiris got in it. It was an ideal fit!\n\nSuddenly, Set closed the box and threw it into the river. “Now I will be king!” Set said.\n\nThe box washed up on a foreign shore after a flood. Isis brought his body home and obtained a grave for him in Egypt. The Egyptian gods thought Isis had done something very romantic. Because of her love, the gods made him the god of the underworld. Osiris returned every spring to help the farmers. Even nowadays, people say Osiris keeps their crops alive."

They thought the food nourished them on their journey from cemeteries to heaven. People had to put out good things for souls to eat. However, if the food rotted or spoiled, the soul got mad. The wicked soul might curse the family and make them starve during the winter.\n\nIn other places, people begged for food on a holiday that remembers the souls of dead saints. People wore disguises with hoods that covered their faces. If they did not get food, they played a trick on the home. For this reason, the activity is known as “trick-or- treating.” Shortly after people first began trick-or-treating, parents started sending their children to beg on that day. Housewives gave the children food if they performed a song or a dance. When people moved to America from all over the world, they brought this tradition with them. Inhabitants of villages started trick-or-treating in the early 1900s. In 1939 a children’s publication acquainted the whole country with the tradition. It became very popular.\n\nToday, trick-or-treaters are not begging for food, and they are not scared of souls. They just enjoy the thrill of dressing up like creatures and getting candy. Ghosts and skeletons are favorite costumes. But some children wear fancy disguises, like pirates. They carry flashlights instead of fires. In some places, children still perform songs or riddles to get candy. But most of the time, they just say “Trick-or-Treat!”"

Among them was Tom, a brave young boy with a passion for solving mysteries. Armed with a flashlight and fueled by curiosity, they set out on their quest.\n\nAs they crept through the cemetery gates, the children couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. Shadows danced among the gravestones, and the wind whispered eerie melodies through the trees.\n\nSuddenly, a figure emerged from the darkness, wearing a hood to disguise their identity. The children gasped in fear, thinking it was a pirate or perhaps even a ghost!\n\nBut as the figure drew nearer, they realized it was only Old Mrs. Thompson, the town's eccentric storyteller. \"What brings you youngsters to the cemetery on such a chilly night?\" she asked with a mischievous grin.\n\n\"We're here to solve the mystery of the cursed cemetery!\" Tom declared boldly, determined to unravel the truth.\n\nMrs. Thompson chuckled softly. \"Ah, a mystery indeed. But sometimes, things are not as they seem.\" With that, she disappeared into the night, leaving the children with a riddle to ponder.\n\nUndeterred, Tom and his friends pressed on, their hearts racing with excitement. They searched every corner of the cemetery, uncovering ancient tombstones and hidden pathways.\n\nSuddenly, they stumbled upon a hidden chamber beneath a gnarled oak tree. Inside, they found a skeleton clutching a publication dated many years ago. It seemed the mystery was finally beginning to unravel.\n\nShortly after their discovery, the children heard a noise from above. They looked up to see the stars twinkling brightly in the sky, casting an eclipse over the cemetery. It was a thrilling sight, but it also brought a sense of comfort and reassurance.\n\nWith renewed determination, Tom and his friends vowed to solve the mystery of the haunted cemetery once and for all. And as they left the cemetery that night, they knew that sometimes, the greatest adventures begin in the most unexpected places."

Just stories to scare the faint-hearted.\"\n\nLily frowned, unwilling to believe that the tales she had heard were nothing but myths. \"But what about the skeletons and the wicked spirits?\" she asked, her voice tinged with doubt.\n\nOld Man Jenkins shook his head. \"Just tricks of the imagination, my dear. The only curse in this cemetery is the one that mankind has placed upon it with their fear and superstition.\"\n\nWith those words, Old Man Jenkins disappeared into the night, leaving Lily to ponder his words. Slowly, she began to realize that perhaps the true curse was not in the cemetery itself, but in the minds of those who believed in its wicked tales.\n\nAnd as she left the cemetery that night, Lily felt a sense of relief wash over her. For she knew that sometimes, the most terrifying stories are the ones we create in our own minds."

Instead of resorting to crime, why not seek out a new prospect and start fresh?\"\n\nJack was taken aback by the wizard's words. He had never considered the possibility of redemption before. With a newfound sense of hope, he vowed to turn his life around and leave his outlaw days behind him.\n\nFrom that day on, Jack worked tirelessly to mend his ways. He returned the purse he had stolen and began to earn an honest living, mowing lawns and helping out around the village.

It all started with a bomb that was planted in the center of town by an unknown culprit.\n\nThe bomb went off during the annual town fair, causing chaos and devastation in its wake. Buildings were destroyed, and many people were injured. The grief and shock that followed were palpable as the townspeople struggled to cope with the tragedy.\n\nAmong the casualties was Mr. Johnson, the beloved grocer who had served the community for decades. His coffin was laid to rest in the town cemetery, surrounded by mourners who had come to pay their respects.\n\nAs the townspeople tried to come to terms with the tragedy, they couldn't help but feel a sense of anger and criticism towards whoever was responsible for the bombing. They gazed at the destruction around them, struggling to comprehend how such a senseless act could have occurred.\n\nMeanwhile, the police launched an investigation to trace the origins of the bomb and bring the perpetrator to justice. They pored over every piece of evidence, from fragments of the bomb itself to witness statements and surveillance footage.\n\nDespite their best efforts, the police were unable to identify the culprit. The mystery of the bombing remained unsolved, leaving the town in a state of uncertainty and fear.\n\nYears passed, and the memory of the bombing faded into the background. Life in Meadowville gradually returned to normal, but the tragedy continued to cast a shadow over the community.\n\nTo honor the memory of those who had been lost, the town council decided to issue a certificate of bravery to the first responders who had risked their lives to save others during the bombing. It was a small gesture, but it served as a reminder of the resilience and strength of the Meadowville community in the face of adversity.\n\nAnd though the scars of the bombing would never fully heal, the people of Meadowville refused to let it define them. They vowed to move forward with hope and determination, knowing that together, they could overcome any challenge that came their way."

The revelation sent shockwaves through the city, as residents grappled with the possibility of nuclear contamination.\n\nAmidst the chaos, the city council convened an emergency congress to address the situation. They listened intently as Dr. Smith presented his findings, outlining the potential consequences of nuclear contamination and the steps that needed to be taken to mitigate the risk.\n\nAs the city descended into a state of panic, Dr. Smith worked tirelessly to cope with the crisis.

        "b": "Many people believe that chocolate originally came from Europe. However, chocolate, called the “food of the gods,” was first made in the Americas. The first chocolate was very different from contemporary chocolate.\n\nWild chocolate trees can grow easily in the humid Amazon rain forest. Clusters of flowers growing on these trees turn to seeds. About 20 to 60 cacao beans can be found in the seeds. Cacao beans are the ingredient needed to create sweet, soothing, and delicious chocolate treats.\n\nThe Mayan and Aztec cultures both thought that chocolate trees were brought from paradise by gods. The Mayans and Aztecs used the beans from this divine tree to create a special beverage with a very pleasant odor. Surprisingly, the Aztecs believed that it would be toxic to women and children.\n\nIn the 1500s, the Spanish explorer Cortes met the Aztecs. Cortes became quite interested in the plantations where the Aztecs cultivated chocolate trees. When he returned to Europe, he took cacao beans with him. He introduced the people of Spain to the Aztecs’ chocolate beverage.\n\nOver the next 100 years or so, kings, queens, and members of the upper class enjoyed drinking chocolate. They enjoyed it even more once they learned to add sugar to the beverage! Soon, chocolate had spread all across Europe. New machines allowed chocolate makers to perfect their products and produce them at a very rapid rate. Preparing the beans in special ways brought out the aroma of chocolate. The beans were combined with condensed milk to give the chocolate a smooth texture.\n\nToday, contemporary chocolates with subtle flavors fill the shelves of expensive chocolate shops. The different types of chocolate available today vary widely. True chocolate lovers can tell which is best, though. They will tell you that the flavor of high quality chocolate stays on the palate long after you finish it."

It was here that the plantation workers gathered each day to cultivate the land and harvest the fruits that would be used to make delicious beverages.\n\nOne of the most prized fruits grown on the plantation was the durian, known for its unique texture and subtle flavor. The durian trees thrived in the humid climate, their fruit prized by connoisseurs for its rich aroma and complex palate.\n\nAs the plantation workers worked to combine the fruits into a beverage, they marveled at the rapid rate at which the durians ripened in the tropical sun.

He thought, “I could sell these monkeys and become very rich! I’m going to take them to England.”\n\nSo the admiral set traps to catch the monkeys. He put stakes in the ground, tied string around them and made loops in the string. When the monkeys ran through the forest, their feet got caught in the loops, and they couldn’t escape. Then the admiral put the monkeys in cages on his ship and sailed away.\n\nThe cages were small and uncomfortable. There was no soft hay for the monkeys to sleep on. Instead, they slept on branches with sharp thorns that cut into the monkeys’ flesh. For dinner, he gave them tiny pieces of sour grapefruit to eat. The monkeys grew hungry and weak.\n\nBut one day, the admiral hired a new steward. He was a kind man with a good conscience. He was horrified to see the thin monkeys in the cages. So one night he let them out.\n\nThe monkeys ran and played all over the ship! They attacked the admiral and the steward and ate their food. They completely wrecked the ship. One monkey ran into a kerosene lamp, and it fell over. The ship caught fire and began to sink! The whole crew was lost except for the monkeys.\n\nAfter the accident, the monkeys jumped onto a raft. They floated away from the fiery blaze of the ship. In the morning, they saw a little island in the distance. The monkeys used a piece of wood as a paddle, and they went toward it. They found the island shaped like an arc. They felt so happy to find a new home, and they still live there today."

The essay was complete! Had somebody in cyberspace written it? I didn’t know, but I was very happy. I printed it out and handed it in. I got an “A.”\n\nAfter that, I used the computer for all my assignments. I’d type the title, wait awhile, and the computer would do it. Every assignment was perfect; I never had to edit anything. I stopped paying attention to my teacher’s lectures and spent my extra time in the gymnasium. And my grades got better and better.\n\nA month later, I was walking into class when my friend said, “Are you prepared for the test?”\n\n“What test?” I asked.\n\n“The geography test!” he replied. “I hope you studied. It’s worth seventy percent of our final grade!”\n\nI failed the test, of course. I was completely ignorant about the subject. After that, I made a resolution never to use the magic computer again. The moral of this story is that if you cheat at school, you won’t learn anything."

        "b": "Sometimes famous people are vain. They only care about themselves. But Josephine Baker was an exception. In the 1930s and 1940s, Baker was one of the most famous women in France. She was a big part of the new jazz genre and culture and had a diverse group of fans. The French people especially loved her. And she loved France. So when World War II started, she wanted to help the nation that had given her so much.\n\nIn 1940, armed German troops entered Paris. When this happened, some French people formed a secret alliance. It was called the French Resistance. The group worked for the defense of France. It helped the European and American armies fight the Germans.\n\nBaker was an important member of the Resistance. She had three jobs. The first was to carry messages to and from other members. The messages were written in code on her sheets of music. The second was to provide shelter and supply goods to Resistance members. It would have been dangerous if the Germans found them.\n\nBaker’s third job was the most important. Baker held concerts for European politicians and army members. She lured them in, promising an entertaining show. She enchanted them with her singing and dancing and got lots of applause. But Baker was always equipped with a small notebook at these concerts. She listened for details about the war and wrote them down. Baker sorted the details and gave authoritative reports to the Resistance.\n\nSome thought Baker’s fame would be an obstacle. The Germans knew who she was, but they didn’t think she was smart enough to work for the Resistance. So she could get information from the Germans easily. This helped the Resistance and the French army save lives and win the war.\n\nBaker had a big impact on the Resistance’s work. She got many awards for her help. When she died, the army had a special ceremony to thank her again for her bravery."

They spoke with confidence and grace, their words carrying the weight of centuries of tradition and history.\n\nEvery detail of the ceremony was carefully planned and executed, from the elaborate costumes worn by the participants to the intricate rituals performed to seal the alliance. It was a momentous occasion, one that would have a lasting impact on the kingdom and its people.\n\nAs the ceremony drew to a close, the guests were invited to partake in a feast fit for royalty. Tables were lined with an abundance of food and drink, representing the diverse cultures of the kingdom and the richness of its heritage.\n\nBut amid the celebrations, there lurked an obstacle that threatened to overshadow the joyous occasion. A group of rebels, opposed to the alliance, had gathered outside the castle walls, armed with weapons and determined to disrupt the ceremony.\n\nDespite the danger, the castle provided shelter for the guests, its fortified walls serving as a defense against the rebels' attacks. The leaders of the alliance stood firm in the face of adversity, refusing to let anything stand in the way of their commitment to peace and unity.\n\nIn the end, the rebels' efforts were in vain, as the ceremony proceeded without interruption, and the alliance between the two cultures was officially sealed. And as the sun set on the horizon, casting a golden glow over the castle, the people of the kingdom knew that they had witnessed something truly magical—the enchanting union of two cultures coming together in harmony."

Tracy’s father, Mr. Grieves, showed them the native plants and animals. “Look,” he said, “that’s a fox’s den. Do you see that bunch of mushrooms next to it. Don’t touch them. They contain poison.” Kara was bored. She didn’t care about nature.\n\nAs the day went on, mighty clouds soon loomed in the distance. “It looks like stormy weather,” said Tracy. “We should go back.” It suddnely began to rain. They used an umbrella to shield them from the rain. Back at the camp, they ate cold sandwiches for dinner and went to sleep.\n\nBy morning, the rain had stopped. It was a drastic change from the previous day’s weather. They folded their sleeping bags and put them in a box. Tracy closed the lid and told Kara, “Today will be fun, I promise!” Kara didn’t believe her. She missed her convenient life in the city. She was used to an urban lifestyle.\n\nAfter breakfast, they went for a walk. The grass was covered with dew, and it gleamed in the sunlight. Finally, they reached a lake. Kara and Tracy waded into the water. The reeds swayed in the wind, and a flock of birds flew above. Kara felt very peaceful.\n\nThat night, they made a fire. They sat around it while Mr. Grieves told scary stories. Kara had a lot of fun. Camping was a good way for friends to spend time together, she realized.\n\nThe next day, it was time for them to leave. She felt sad while they exited the park. She didn’t like camping at first, but she learned how fun it could be over the weekend."

        "b": "Many scientists and intellectuals think that dinosaurs died when an asteroid smashed into the Earth millions of years ago. However, recently, there has been some controversy over this theory. Some scientists think that it isn’t accurate. They think that a tiny insect may have been the biggest factor in the death of these huge creatures. That insect was the mosquito.\n\nThese scientists do think that an asteroid hit the Earth the time of the dinosaurs. But that wasn’t what killed all of them. At that time, insects, including the mosquito, were beginning to evolve. Today, we can regulate the number of mosquitoes with pesticides. But that was impossible millions of years ago. The mosquitoes multiplied quickly. And they were certainly not idle. Since there were so many mosquitoes, it was easy for them to bite many of the dinosaurs. When they bit another living thing, the mosquitoes passed along a deadly disease. So the dinosaurs were stricken with the disease. A vast majority of them, from the vegetarians to the meat eaters, died.\n\nTo reinforce this idea, scientists stress how gradually the dinosaurs died. If an asteroid killed them, they would have died very quickly. But the number of dinosaurs decreased slowly. In addition, scientists have found genetic material of mosquitoes in fossils. This material proves that mosquitoes existed back then. Although there may have been other factors, the dinosaurs died mainly because of disease, the scientists say.\n\nNo matter how it happened, the dinosaurs’ death had a major impact on other living things. Many dinosaurs ate mammals. After the dinosaurs died, mammals were able to evolve and produce offspring. Birds also evolved. Scientists have analyzed the genomes of birds, and they discovered that birds have identical genetic material to some dinosaurs. So there may still be dinosaurs among us after all."

They consulted their books and learned that it was actually an asteroid, a large rock that had traveled through space before crashing into the Earth.\n\nThe discovery of the asteroid sparked controversy among the townspeople, with some fearing that it might be a sign of impending danger. But the children were undeterred, eager to learn more about the asteroid and its origins.\n\nWith the help of their teacher, Miss Emily, the children set out to evolve their understanding of asteroids and space. They learned about factors such as gravity and velocity, which played a role in the asteroid's journey through the cosmos.\n\nAs they delved deeper into their research, the children discovered that asteroids could contain valuable genetic information that could help scientists better understand the universe. They learned about the genome of the asteroid, which contained clues about its composition and history.\n\nDespite facing intellectual challenges along the way, such as understanding complex scientific concepts, the children persevered, determined to unlock the secrets of the asteroid.

Cloud forests are also in danger of disappearing, but little is being done to save them.\n\nThese forests are located at the tops of mountains, generally near the equator. These humid, wooded mountaintops are mainly in African and Central and South American countries. They are called “cloud forests” because their height allows for the formation of clouds among the trees.\n\nRainforests produce large amounts of oxygen. Cloud forests produce comparative amounts of water. The trees in these forests pull water out of the clouds. The moisture gathers on the leaves. When it drips, it is deposited into streams. The streams flow into towns at the bottom of the mountain. Then, it’s distributed to people. The yearly cumulative rainfall in these areas is 173-198 centimeters. Cloud forests can pull in up to 60 percent of that. This water is crucial to the plants and the people in the area. It helps them survive.\n\nCloud forests are also the birthplace of countless species of plants that can’t be found anywhere else.

Thucydides was incredulous that gods caused the plague, but he explained why others believed it. There was an old, long verse which predicted the disease. To paraphrase it, the verse said the gods would send a disease during a war. As a result, large crowds gathered at shrines to ask the gods to stop the plague.

        "b": "We live in a mobile society. But the cars we drive require too much gas, plus they pollute the air. Eventually, the natural resources used to make gas will run out. So what happens then? Many people think solar-powered automobiles are the answer. To learn more about this type of transportation, teams from universities and corporate organizations gather in Australia every two years for a solar car race.\n\nThe race is called the World Solar Challenge. Candidates for this tournament must design their own cars. The teams keep all their plans confidential. They don’t interact with other teams because the race is very competitive. And these cars aren’t just enhanced and modified versions of normal cars. They are completely different.\n\nThe cars only have room for one person and are very simple inside—they don’t even have a cushion for the driver to sit on. These cars are shorter and much more flat than normal cars. Most importantly, the cars incorporate solar panels onto the outside that lie parallel to each other. These panels are made from materials that take in light from the sun and turn it into electric energy. That’s how they move.\n\nThese cars race over 3,000 kilometers across the Australian territories. The drivers have to heed strict guidelines. They must stop at certain intervals to charge their batteries. And unlike normal race cars, they can’t go very fast. They have to drive at the normal speed limits. Although the drivers want to finish the race quickly, that is not the main goal. The objective is to see how well the cars work under normal driving conditions.\n\nBecause of the World Solar Challenge, a new era in car making and in driving is beginning. People may ridicule the solar cars because they look strange, but this is a phenomenon that isn’t going away. Using the technology from the vehicles, car makers will eventually create solar cars for the rest of us."

He was organized, but he was greedy and took too much clothing. His wardrobe was filled with his own products. Tom was once a sergeant in the army. He ran a martial arts school, but his stance on discipline was too strong. He had almost no students.\n\nOne day, they received a telegraph saying that their father had died. They were heirs to his old farm. They planned to sell it as soon as possible, so they went to see it even though there was a terrible storm. The house didn’t look great, but there was a lot of land. There was so much, in fact, that they could barely see its boundary.\n\nSuddenly, the storm got worse. The sheer force of the wind almost knocked them over. Martin said, “Look, it’s a typhoon!” Paul said, “No, it’s a cyclone.” Tom said, “No, it’s a tornado!” They argued until Paul began to wail and said, “Whatever it is, it’s coming right at us! We’re doomed!” The three brothers scrambled inside the old house. Martin said, “If we survive, we must stop fighting. This farm could be great if we fixed it up. With my hard work, Paul’s organization and Tom’s discipline, we could run a great business together!” The storm finally ended. And luckily, it didn’t wreck the farm.\n\n“Just think,” Martin said, “it took the chaos of a typhoon to bring us together.” Paul replied, “You mean a cyclone brought us together.” Tom said, “Didn’t I tell you both that it was a tornado?” The brothers never agreed on what kind of storm it was, but by combining their skills, they started a successful farm."

Mark was proud of his work, but when John saw the statue, he laughed aloud.\n\n“What’s so funny?” Mark asked.\n\nJohn replied, “Your ignorance makes me laugh. Don’t you know that Tut was only a teenager when he was pharaoh? Let me help you. I’ll supervise your work. I’ll give you feedback, and we’ll make this a great monument.”\n\nMark got another cube of stone. John told him what Tut looked like. “Make him tall with good posture,” John said. “And make sure there is symmetry in his body.”\n\nMark conferred with John about every detail.

Later, people from northern Africa and Italy also had ideas about a similar invention. In fact, a Leonardo Da Vinci’s drawing corresponds closely with the modern parachute design!\n\nIn 1783, French scientist Sebastian Lenormand invented the first modern parachute. Sebastian brainstormed with other scientists to come up with a way to help people jump safely out of burning buildings. He thought the solution was to give people an object to restrict their speed while they traveled toward the ground. Many people thought that he was up to some kind of fraud, but Sebastian had a lot of integrity. His budget was limited, so he first tested his theory by using two umbrellas. He jumped out of a tree and found that the umbrellas worked.\n\nNext, he refined his invention. Rather than using umbrellas, he knit a large parachute. Finally, he jumped off a tall building on a French estate and landed safely in the courtyard.\n\nSebastian’s work gave another man an idea. Jean-Pierre Blanchard had a different outlook than Sebastian. He was a hot air balloon addict. He was one of the first people to ride in a hot air balloon powered by hydrogen gas. He was a proponent of using the parachutes to exit from hot air balloons. Starting in 1785, he used his dog to show that animals could land safely from hot air balloons by using parachutes. Then, in 1793, he was faced with a chaotic experience. The hot air balloon he was riding in burst and started to fall. He was forced to use a parachute himself.

There was graffiti on it, and it had many holes in it. The worst part was that one of Billy’s fellow students said she thought she saw Billy do it!\n\nBut Billy didn’t do it. The principal called Billy’s parents and said, “Billy won’t tell us the truth. He’s a chronic liar, and he ruined the painting. If you don’t pay for it, we’ll terminate his education here.”\n\nBilly’s parents didn’t have enough money to pay for the painting and for his tuition. But Billy’s parents had an idea. That afternoon, they went to see Mr. Meyers, an attorney.\n\n“Mr. Meyers, my son has been implicated in a crime he says he didn’t do,” Billy’s father said. “Everybody believes the gossip. Even some of our own kin think he did it!”\n\n“I believe you. My suspicion is that the tape from the security cameras will show who really did it,” said Mr. Meyers.\n\nThe next day, Mr. Meyers received a packet with the videotape from the school. It showed another student who resembled Billy walking up to the painting and writing on it. Then the student took a knife by the shaft and started to stab large holes in it. Finally, he severed the rope that held up the painting, and it fell to the floor.\n\nMr. Meyers showed the tape to the principal. “Clearly, that’s not Billy,” he said. “This boy is actually responsible and needs some discipline.”\n\nBilly was happy that someone believed him. He said to Mr. Meyers, “When I graduate and go to university, I will major in law, so I can be a guardian of justice like you!”"

He knew he may never be set free, but it was a decision that he was willing to accept.\n\nIn the morning, he was led from the prisoners’ compound to one of the king’s arenas. A gate coated in rust stood between him and the auditorium’s floor. He was worried, but he knew what he had to do.\n\nWhen the gate opened, he calmly walked to the center of the arena and sat. He started to meditate. His foe Darius, who was skilled in the realm of sword fighting and was typically not very aggressive, would not fight the quiet soldier until he attacked Darius first.\n\nDarius tried to provoke him by hacking at the air close to his head with his sword. But the soldier was not distracted. He sat quietly, as if he were dumb, and looked calmly up at the sky. Even when Darius nicked him on the cheek with the edge of his sword, the soldier did not move.\n\nAt last he threw down his sword and shield and gave up. “I can’t fight someone who refuses to fight me!” Darius shouted to the king.\n\nThe king was very impressed with the soldier. Never in any battle had he seen someone so brave. As a result, he gave the peaceful soldier amnesty. The soldier’s actions proved to the king and everyone in the arena that peace was more powerful than fighting."

They are made up of compressed electrical circuits that can detect and record data about the body. They are tiny, but they hold the equivalent amount of data as most computers.\n\nA microchip is put to use inside a person with a simple procedure. First, a doctor must put data about the patient onto a chip. Input about the person’s age, race, gender, and medical history is stored on the chip. The second phase of the process involves putting it in the person’s skin. The doctor pinches a piece of skin and cuts a tiny hole with a tool shaped like a spiral. The chip is inserted, and the skin is allowed to heal. At last, it begins the task of putting data into its database.\n\nMicrochips scan the patient’s body to record what is happening on the quantum level. They can find problems with the person’s metabolism and organs. They can also detect viral infections. They can find the aggregate number of immune and infected cells and present the results in a ratio. They can even tell doctors what type of antibiotic to give to the patient!\n\nTo recover the chip’s data, the doctor uses a special magnet that copies it. This way, the doctor can put the information from the chip onto a computer. Then they can find out exactly what is wrong with the person.\n\nThe idea of putting chips in humans is still very new. However, it is now becoming more prevalent. Scientists and doctors are hopeful about the future uses of microchips. Someday, all new babies might get a microchip soon after they are born.

They knew that they needed to restore the animals' confidence in the nectar and the administration's ability to protect them.\n\nWith this in mind, the council decided to be explicit about the findings of their investigation. They held a meeting with all the animals of the forest and presented their findings in a straightforward manner, dispelling the notion that the nectar was harmful.\n\nAs the truth about the nectar was revealed, the animals felt a sense of relief wash over them. They realized that they had been prone to believing deceptive rumors, but now they could trust in the ethics of their leaders and the scientific expertise of the coalition.\n\nAnd so, as the animals returned to their daily lives, they did so with a renewed appreciation for the nectar of the flowers and the importance of seeking truth and understanding in the face of fear and uncertainty."

Animals couldn’t thrive in such conditions.\n\nHe took out some stationery and wrote a letter to the zoo. He offered to help the zoo buy huge cages for the large mammals and reptiles. He offered to buy healthy food for the orangutans to increase their longevity. He even said that he would buy new glass walls for the aquarium because the old ones were cracked.\n\nJoe’s act of philanthropy intrigued the zookeeper. He probed Joe to learn why he spent his money to improve the zoo. It wasn’t a social convention for a person to be so gracious.\n\nJoe told the zookeeper, “I know it’s not the norm, but my ultimate decision to help I these animals is better than anything I could have done for myself. If I ever write an autobiography, I will write that this was the happiest day of my life.”"

The other is known as Polaris, the North Star. Polaris is special because it is the only star that always appears to be in the same place in the sky. Therefore, Polaris is a great compass. When people in the northern hemisphere of Earth look toward Polaris, they can be certain that they are facing north. The permanence of Polaris in the north sky has helped countless people find their destinations.\n\nBefore the invention of modern navigation tools, mariners relied on Polaris. From the top of their hulls, sailors would look for Polaris to figure out their place at sea. They figured out the angle between the star and the horizon to determine their latitude. As long as the equations weren’t erroneous, the results were very reliable. Polaris also let sailors determine North, South, East, and West. By knowing directions and their location, mariners could easily navigate their ships.\n\nTo those who sail at night, volatile storms and dark clouds were more than nuisances. They could disrupt entire journeys by blocking the view of Polaris. A captain could err and make an inadvertent wrong turn. The ship could become stranded at sea, and the frantic captain would have no way to improvise to get the ship back on the right course. The mariner’s fears wouldn’t be soothed until the clouds cleared and Polaris came back into view. Even today, sailors sometimes opt to navigate by using Polaris on clear nights.\n\nIt’s not difficult to differentiate Polaris from other stars. The Big Dipper, a constellation that is well known in astrology, appears to revolve around Polaris. The handle of the Big Dipper always points to the North Star. When people get lost, it’s comforting to know that their problems can be alleviated by looking at the sky."

The columns of hair were a ridiculous tangle of wigs, jewels, flowers, and even stuffed birds.\n\nMen’s fashion was similarly absurd. Today it would probably seem very feminine.

I bet I can take more bites of this chili than you,” Russell said.\n\nBecky was wary of eating the pepper. Despite her reluctance, she didn’t want to say no to the bet. She wavered about whether to do it or not. She negotiated the details. “What will the winner get?” she asked.\n\n“The loser has to carry the winner’s books for a year!

The chili looked benign, but Becky knew it could cause a lot of pain. She bit the bottom of the pepper. Surprisingly, she felt nothing.\n\n“ My turn,” said Russell. He bit the middle of the chili. Immediately, he seemed to be in distress. He gasped and his face alternated between brave and pained expressions. He experienced an overdose of spice. He was on the verge of tears and finally let out a horrible cry.\n\n“Take this,” said Becky, handing him her drink.\n\n“That was awful!” he said, continuing to sip from the glass.\n\nThat night, Becky researched chilies. The next day she said in an apologetic voice, “ I read that the hot part of chilies is in the middle, where the seeds are.

        "b": "Once, a British gazette had an unusual story. Scientists at a zoo made a discovery about komodo dragons. Komodo dragons are giant lizards that grow up to two and a half meters long. A female lizard at the zoo had babies. However, it had never been around a male lizard in its entire life. After the scientists publicized their discovery, many people thought it was fictitious.\n\nBut it was true. It was discovered that female komodo dragons can have babies without the help of their male counterparts. This contradicts what scientists know about how most animals have babies.\n\nIn most cases, there are many things that can obstruct this type of reproduction. For example, adult males and females carry different genes needed to make an embryo. If the genes are homogeneous, the babies are weaker and have genetic problems. Over time, the weakened species dies out completely. This makes it necessary for the male to be involved. However, scientists verified that when Komodo babies are born, their genes aren’t the exact same genes as their mother. Also, they are devoid of any genetic problems.\n\nScientists theorize that Komodo dragons developed the ability because it helps the species fend off extinction. If a volcano erupts, lava can kill all of the komodo dragons on an island. However, as long as one female eludes death, she can prolong the survival of the species. Luckily, Komodo dragons are vigorous swimmers. So the surviving female can plunge into the ocean and swim to another island. When she comes ashore, she can reproduce by herself. Over time, the genes within the population diverge. Then, the sparse population increases. Once again there is a surplus of lizards on one island. Scientists think that this may be how the lizards took over all of the islands in that area."

The text was written in at least three different ancient languages. After many years, experts realized it contained a number of spells that varied greatly in scope.\n\nThe most common types of magic in the collection dealt with healing illnesses like pneumonia. Some spells also gave advice for treating people with mental illnesses, such as those who became psychotic. Some spells asked for unusual things, like crocodile dung. But botany was an important part of the magic. Many healing spells gave instructions on how to use herbs and plants that were believed to be therapeutic. For example, in order to cure arthritis, the book says that the magician should build an ornate altar. Then he should mash different types of herbs and place them on top of it. At dusk, he is supposed to say a spell, so the gods would be gratified.\n\nOther parts of the collection describe how to hone one’s psychic abilities and how to give credible descriptions of the future. Often, the book advised people how to use different objects to tell the future, including tea leaves. Also, one part of the book tells what different dreams might mean. It gives advice for using dreams to tell the future.\n\nA small part of the book, however, is more sinister than the rest. It is meant to cause strife and deception. For example, one tells how to give someone warts, while another will make all of the victim’s farm animals die.

The snake only goes into homes to chase pests such as mice. Otherwise, it stays in the fields, where it’s dangerous to people who forage for food there. If someone stuns it by accidentally stepping on it, it bites to protect itself. At first, the effects of the bite may seem negligible because it doesn’t cause a lot of bleeding. However, after a few moments, the venom induces paralysis in the area where the individual was bitten. Furthermore, the venom can also impede respiration. If the person doesn’t go to the doctor, they are susceptible to kidney deterioration.\n\nOthers would argue that tigers have the worst bite. Mother tigers are inseparable from their babies and seem to be the gentlest creatures when they are around their young. However, if the babies are threatened, the mother tiger’s savage nature prevails. With strong jaws and the ability to move quickly, the tiger can kill someone with one bite. That’s because it always tries to bite an important artery when it attacks. If the artery is ruptured, the victim will bleed to death.\n\nIn the mainstream, animal bites are seen as the most dangerous. But some scientists think this idea is invalid. In fact, the most dangerous bite might be the human bite. When scientists magnified the contents in human saliva, they found about three hundred different microbes in it. A human bite can be dangerous if the bacteria enters the body through a cut, which can make people very sick. Furthermore, most people don’t realize how serious a man bit can be, so they don't go to the doctor right away. This gives the wound a chance to get infected and cause more problems."

The sky grew overcast, and an eerie silence fell over the mountains—an omen of the impending danger.\n\nSuddenly, without warning, an avalanche of snow and ice came crashing down from the mountainside, burying the trail beneath a mountain of rubble. Sarah's heart raced with fear as she realized they were trapped in the avalanche's path.\n\nWith quick thinking, Sarah's father, a seasoned ranger, sprang into action. He activated the cabin's aerial apparatus—a device designed to send out a distress signal in case of emergencies. As the signal was discharged into the air, Sarah and her family clung to each other, praying for help to arrive.\n\nHours passed, and the snow continued to accumulate around them. Sarah's family remained calm, their consistency in the face of danger giving her hope.

His muscles were a testament to his strong work ethic. He believed that if he worked hard, great things would happen for him. On his first day, he worked for hours cleaning and making repairs.

At the onset of smallpox, people suffered from high fevers, headaches, vomiting, and aching muscles. Yet the worst symptom of all was an intolerable rash that caused irritation on the entire body. Those who survived the disease were often rendered blind or left with gross scars on their face and body.\n\nToday, however, cases of smallpox are very rare due to the work of many countries during the late 1900s. This federation of countries collaborated to completely destroy smallpox. Early in the century, wealthy countries in Europe and North America had developed a substance that made the body immune to smallpox. They had required all their citizens to get this vaccine to counteract the disease. Hence, the people of these countries no longer had to worry about smallpox.\n\nHowever, many of the needy people in poorer parts of the world still suffered from the disease. Their countries could not afford the vaccine nor supply enough doctors to curb the spread of smallpox.\n\nIn 1950, the wealthier countries of the world vowed to free the world of the disease. They pledged to supply the vaccine to any country that could not afford it. Scientists compiled lists of areas where the disease still thrived. Then doctors diagnosed people who had the disease in these areas. They enacted laws that prohibited people with smallpox from mixing with those who did not. In this way, they could not transmit the disease to others. Then the doctors gave all of them the vaccine.\n\nIt took a longtime and a lot of work. But nearly thirty years later, on December 9,1979, a group of scientists certified that smallpox had been successfully stopped. The humane efforts of people from all over the world had accomplished a great task."

Since people did not have access to other sources, they had to drink the dirty water.\n\nThe outbreak spread rapidly and infected almost 16,000 people. The illness caused extreme pain in people’s intestines. It also caused a deficiency of important fluids in sick people’s bodies. Without the proper fluids and minerals, metabolic processes stopped working correctly. People were unable to digest food properly or replenish their lost nutrients. If they had not received viable treatment, they would have been likely to die. It was imperative for help to come soon.\n\nHowever, the government of Zimbabwe was unable to provide help to its people. The government didn’t have a plan to stop the spread of cholera. In addition, the country was too poor to get clean water or medication for the sick. The people seemed to be doomed.\n\nLuckily, many other countries recognized the paramount need to contain the outbreak. Dozens of voluntary practitioners from Britain, France, the United States, and other countries went to Zimbabwe to treat the disease.

Among them was Benny the Clown, known for his clumsy antics and oversized shoes.\n\nAs Benny stumbled around backstage, he collided with props and tripped over his own feet, much to the amusement of his fellow performers. But despite his clumsiness, Benny was determined to put on a show that would wow the audience.\n\nAs the circus tent filled with spectators, Benny took to the stage, juggling brightly colored balls and performing silly tricks to the delight of the crowd. But disaster struck when he accidentally knocked over a set piece, sending it crashing to the ground with a flammable thud.\n\nThe audience gasped as flames erupted from the fallen prop, sending performers and spectators into a panic. The circus staff quickly sprang into action, evacuating the tent and extinguishing the fire before it could spread.\n\nIn the aftermath of the chaos, Benny was singled out as the culprit of the accident. His clumsy antics had caused the premature end to the show, and he felt a wave of resentment wash over him as he faced the scrutiny of the circus staff.\n\nBut as the billionaire owner of the circus approached Benny backstage, he surprised everyone by offering his support. Instead of punishing Benny for his mistake, he recognized the value of Benny's comedic talents and suggested that he use his clumsiness as a subject for satire in future performances.\n\nEmboldened by the billionaire's encouragement, Benny took to the stage once more, this time embracing his clumsy nature and turning it into a source of laughter for the audience. His uproarious antics brought the crowd to tears of joy, and he was hailed as a hero of the circus."

It worked by releasing an electromagnetic pulse into the cloud. This pulse, in turn, stimulated the electrons in the cloud’s particles. Then the electrons produced lightning.\n\nBut his meteorological experiment had a major defect. He couldn’t get the device into the sky.\n\nHe had tied it to balloons, but they had burst. He had shot the device from a cannon, but the force of the cannon had damaged it.\n\n“You should give up,” his friends told him. “You’ll never get that thing into the air.”\n\nBut his friends’ criticisms only spurred him to try again. The student was very innovative, and at last, he thought that he had an innovation that would work. He attached wings to the device, and on one dreary day, when clouds blocked the light of the sun, he started his experiment anew.\n\nHe placed the device on a rocket and launched it into the sky. The propulsion of the rocket carried the device high into the air. The rocket accelerated into the clouds and then released the device. It glided on its wings through the clouds, and when it penetrated the center of a large black cloud, it emitted the electromagnetic pulse. And just as he had predicted, lightning shot from the cloud!\n\nHe called his professors, and the next day they came to watch. He successfully duplicated the experiment. His teachers were extremely impressed and called the student and his invention ingenious.\n\nThe student was given many awards and became a famous inventor. He had not given up.

That’s because doctors in the 1800s were influenced more by primal medical beliefs than science.\n\nRather than thinking the brain caused seizures, people in the 180' still thought they were the result of strange forces. They equated seizures with the work of evil spirits. Others felt that the seizures had a cosmic or lunar cause. They believed that the cycles of the moon and constellations could make someone have a seizure.\n\nDuring a session to treat a patient who had seizures, doctors would force the patient to invoke the grace of the Almighty. They thought if the patient did this, then the patient would rid themselves of the evil spirits causing the seizures.\n\nThe advent of modern psychiatry occurred during the 1800s. At that time people who suffered from seizures were placed in psychiatric hospitals. They were treated like they were insane. However, none of the outmoded treatments worked.\n\nIt wasn’t until the late 1850s that the causes of seizures were understood. We know today that these causes pertain to the brain. Misfired signals from the brain cause a jerking reflex in the body. These usually occur when someone is very tired.\n\nOnce the causes of seizures were known, definitive treatments were developed. Today, treatments range from taking pills to having surgery. Treatment is personalized according to the type of seizure the patient has.\n\nEven today, some people are unsure about seizures. Their most common mistake is thinking that a person having a seizure will swallow their tongue. They often shove some utensil in the person’s mouth. However, this doesn’t help. The utensil often blocks the airway and prevents the person from inhaling. Yet most of the public no longer fear people who have seizures. Instead, they can now help and comfort a person if they have a seizure."

        "b": "Last year, Erik constructed one of the world’s strangest houses in the glacial landscape of northern Sweden. He called it the Ice House: a house made entirely of ice and snow. All of the beds, chairs, tables, and walls are cold, hard sculptures of ice.\n\nA group of architects and volunteers from all over the world traveled to the site of the Ice House and began its construction. The multicultural group journeyed through blizzards and frigid temperatures to reach the site. Once the builders arrived, there was an interchange of ideas, and tools were allocated to each worker. An expert was selected to oversee the building process to make sure there was no discord between the workers. Once a plan was generated, they got right to work. The design was very unique; the builders couldn’t replicate the design from normal houses.\n\nThe first step was to build the walls and ceiling. The builders used a metal frame to help them build the structure. After the ice was in place, the frame was removed. The builders then created furniture and art pieces. Designs were carved into each piece. One worker carved big wavy lines, and another made tiny clockwise, concentric circles. Finally, the workers carved small cavities in the roof and inserted colored lights. When the work was finished, the beautiful house was ready for a resident to enjoy.\n\nLiving in the Ice House is an experience like no other. Erik stores his belongings in an ice locker and lays out a sleeping bag on his ice bed. At dinner, he dines on a delicious salad with crisp toppings. And for the main course, he enjoys appetizing fish caught from a nearby river. The fish are pierced with icicles and served on ice plates. After dinner, he gets ready for a cold night. The omission of heaters can be too much for his visitors sometimes. Luckily, there are warm rooms nearby, as a courtesy to people who get too cold."

        "b": "Overpopulation is a big problem in the world today. Too many people are crammed into cities and towns around the globe. Earth’s population is about 6.5 billion people. This number is growing every day. In just 50 years, the population will be almost 9 billion.\n\nMany people worry that the Earth won’t have enough resources to support so many people. One major reason for this is that wasting resources and polluting have become habitual behaviors. Industrial output results in polluting the air with dangerous fumes. Also, cars and machines waste a ton of important natural resources like oil and water. It’s possible that the Earth may become so damaged that it cannot support a large population of humans.\n\nAnother issue is the lack of useful land for cultivating crops. Even today, many people subsist on mere scraps of food and little water. In 50 years, many experts worry that huge numbers of people will starve to death. So what is being done to prepare for the future?\n\nPeople are realizing they can no longer justify their wasteful behavior or defer action to fix it. Many car companies already have patents on prototypes for very efficient cars. Such cars waste no resources and produce no pollution. A conversion to clean cars means that petroleum can be saved for the future. In addition, the environmental sectors of many governments are setting strict rules for industries that pollute too much. If companies do not abide by the standards, they are penalized with higher taxes. In some cases, their operations might be suspended altogether.\n\nFood is also an issue that is being tackled. Many countries are now subscribing to the point of view that immediate action is needed. They are determining ways to export goods to people in need, so that no one goes hungry. Experts will continue to come up with ideas for the future, and a synthesis of these ideas will help to support the growing population."

So what did they do? Since they had so much free time during the long, cold winters, the inventive farmers started performing tricks to entertain themselves. They used their farm tools and anything they could find to make their tricks more spectacular. They even twisted their bodies into crazy shapes and performed awesome jumps. Overtime, they became great acrobats, and their art form came to be known as “ Hundred Plays.”\n\nHundred Plays involves doing many kinds of tricks. For example, in Mandarin-speaking parts of China, performers do the lion dance. They wear costumes and mimic the animal’s movements. Early performers also did tricks on ropes and vines that were high above the ground.\n\nEven though the acrobats’ fluid movements may have looked easy, they took a lot of work.\n\nLearning Hundred Plays is a communal event. A veteran of the acrobatic arts usually teaches younger people in the village. They spend a lot of time rehearsing. The young performers also learn an old philosophy. The teachings help them harmonize the sensory aspects of acrobatics with mental aspects. In other words, it teaches them to use their physical and mental strength together.\n\nSince the art has its origins with poor farmers, rich people used to scorn acrobats. They thought acrobats were villains. The rich people thought the acrobats just wanted to trick them. But later, their misguided opinions changed. Acrobats came to be respected in Chinese society. They were invited to perform in metropolitan areas as well as in small villages. They performed for important people, including judicial officers. Arts advocacy groups convinced the government to support Chinese acrobatics. As a result, there is now a statute that made several villages the center of training future acrobats."

Fortunately, the truck made it safely across, but most of the ore fell into the river below.\n\nNext, it was a very hot day. The thermometer read over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The truck’s engine became too hot, so the driver parked it in the shade of a grove of trees until it cooled down.\n\nLater, he took a wrong turn. He stopped and took out his binoculars. He scanned his surroundings and eventually discovered a landmark that led him back to the proper route.\n\nFinally, he arrived at the pier, but the ship wasn’t there. When he asked about the ship’s whereabouts, a man said that it had left thirty minutes ago. He had not fulfilled his duty. He realized then the paradox of the shortcut. The shortest route can be the longest, and vice versa, a long route may be the fastest."

        "b": "One morning, Lucas sat outside with his grandfather. They looked past the gravel road that led to a natural reservoir on the delta. On the other side of the water, there was a cottage.\n\n“ Does a ghost live there?” Lucas asked.\n\n“ No, a mad hatter lives there,” said his grandfather. Lucas didn’t know what a mad hatter was, but the image of a scary man haunted him.\n\nLater, Lucas went for a walk in the forest. He collected pieces of amber and granite that he found on the ground. He looked at the moss on the trees and watched a bird peck at the ground. But the forest was like a maze. Soon, Lucas was lost.\n\nLucas heard somebody behind him. He wanted to run away, but he fell. He had a streak of blood on his shirt and some pebbles stuck in his skin. Then a man appeared.\n\n“ I will take you home. First, let’s get you cleaned up,” he said.\n\nLucas followed him. When they arrived at the cottage, he realized the man was the mad hatter!\n\nHe sat down inside. It smelled like charcoal, but it looked like a normal house. The man brought Lucas back some medicine.\n\n“ It’s a bit old, but it’s not expired,” the man said.\n\nWhile Lucas cleaned his cut, the man washed the blood out of his shirt with detergent.\n\nLucas asked, “Are you a mad hatter?”\n\nThe man laughed and replied, “That’s a euphemism for a crazy person. Actually, I’m pretty normal. I’m a columnist fora newspaper,” said the man. He pointed to his credentials which hung on the wall.\n\nLucas could hear the crickets outside. It was getting dark, so he asked, “Could you take me home now?”\n\nThe man said yes. Lucas was surprised that people thought the man was crazy. He was actually very courteous. Maybe Lucas should have a more liberal attitude. Next time, Lucas wouldn’t make judgments about people without getting to know them first."
